Sometimes you want your exports to blend in with your Emacs theme.

This currently only works with LaTeX exports, but it would be nice if more
formats could be supported in future. To use with LaTeX just change the
documents =#+latex_class= to use the pseudo-class =chameleon= and
~org-latex-default-class~ will be used with some extra generated preamble content
to make the result similar to your buffer ðŸ™‚.

* Required =ox-latex= tweaks

For =ox-chameleon= to work, two things are needed:
1. Some KOMA-script tooling, provided by either
   a. Using a KOMA class, such as =scrartcl=, =scrrept=, or =scrbook=
   b. Adding the =scrextend= package
2. The =xcolor= package, if its not already part of the preamble

To add packages to the LaTeX preamble globally, you can use
~org-latex-packages-alist~ like so

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-latex-packages-alist '("" "scrextend" nil))
(add-to-list 'org-latex-packages-alist '("" "xcolor" nil))
#+end_src

Alternatively, you can just add them to documents where =ox-chameleon= is used,
like so

#+begin_src org
,#+latex_header: \usepackage{scrextend}
,#+latex_header: \usepackage{xcolor}
#+end_src
